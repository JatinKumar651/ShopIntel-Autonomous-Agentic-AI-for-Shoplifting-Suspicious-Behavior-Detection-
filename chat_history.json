    "agent_response": "Agent: Thank you for sharing this with me. I want you to know that handling suspicious activity incidents takes courage and awareness.\n\n**Here's what I want to emphasize:**\n\n*   You did the right thing by being observant and reporting this incident. It's important to address these situations to protect the store and your colleagues. I understand it can be upsetting to discover something like this, especially when it involves someone you work with.\n\n*   My immediate advice is to make sure you've documented everything clearly - the date, time, who you suspect, and a summary of what you saw on the CCTV. Secure the CCTV footage as evidence.\n\n*   **Next steps:** Follow your store's policy on theft or employee misconduct. Typically, this involves reporting the incident to your manager or loss prevention team. Do you know who you should report this to?\n\n*   Remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you. Let me know if you have any questions about the reporting process or if you just need to talk.

    "agent_response": "Hi there. Thank you for reaching out. I understand you're dealing with a situation where someone from your store stole a cold drink bottle worth $200, and you have CCTV footage of it. That's a difficult situation to navigate, and it's good that you're reporting it.\n\n**Here's what I want to emphasize:**\n\n*   You did the right thing by reporting this. Internal theft is serious and needs to be addressed.\n\nLet's break down how we can approach this:\n\n1.  **Stay Calm and Objective**: It's natural to feel upset or angry, but try to remain calm and objective when handling the situation.\n\n2.  **Secure the Evidence**: Make sure the CCTV footage is securely saved and backed up. This is crucial for any further action.\n\n3.  **Review Store Policy**: Familiarize yourself with your store's policy on theft and disciplinary actions. This will guide your next steps.\n\n4.  **Inform Management/Owner**: If you're not the owner or manager, immediately inform them about the incident and provide them with the CCTV footage. They need to be involved in making decisions about how to proceed.\n\n5.  **Consider Legal Implications**: Depending on the store policy and the value of the stolen item, consider whether involving law enforcement is necessary. This is something to discuss with your manager/owner.\n\n6.  **Maintain Confidentiality**: It's essential to keep this matter confidential and only discuss it with those who need to know (management, HR, potentially law enforcement).\n\nRemember, dealing with theft can be stressful, but by following a clear procedure and involving the right people, you can handle the situation professionally. How are you feeling about the situation right now? Is there anything specific you're worried about or need help with in terms of the next steps?\n"
